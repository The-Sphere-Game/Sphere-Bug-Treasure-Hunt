# Sphere-Bug-Treasure-Hunt

Hello Spherians,

Due to our use of ORB as exotic fuel for a lot of our technology, they are prone to malfunctioning due to Sphere Builder technology to be experimental in nature so...

We need you! Our Spherian Bounty Hunters to hunt for these bugs. Successfully identified new bugs will be rewarded with treasures from The Sphere.

On a serious note, we are looking for people to help us identify bugs and be rewarded ORBs and NFTs. Thank you in advance for reporting.

Please create an issue (under the ISSUES tab) and be as descriptive as possible as to where and how the bug if triggered. Very vague descriptions with no easy way to trigger the bug will have less chance of being fixed and rewarded.

For best chance of rewards please submit as much details about your device, username, TG ID, browser, settings and so on. Your TG ID Can be found by messaging this bot on Telegram: @tg_id_bot

Happy Bug Hunting!
